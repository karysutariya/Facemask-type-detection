List of file:
1. Data folder -  this folder content images of five categories "Cloth mask", "No face mask",
"Surgical mask", "N95 mask", "Mask worn incorrectly". 
2. main.ipynb - code for face mask detection with Data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing, model traing with testing and evaluation. 

To run this code, all required libraries which has been used in main.ipynb must be installed. Then one can simply execute all code blocks subsequently. This jupyter file includes both training and application part.  

Note: In this code, we have implemented three different models. Here, one should take care of "load_model = False" so if this condition is false for a model, it won't be loaded. By default, this condition is true for main model (model no 1)
